# Create a new sources repository with a standard template

To ensure portability of code between `timelink` projects a standard
layout for the directory containing the project `kleio` sources was
created.

To create a new git repository for a new project you to
register with `github` first at http://github.com.

Then go to https://github.com/joaquimrcarvalho/timelink-sources-template 
and click the `Use this template` button. 

Choose a name for the project repository, decide if it is public or private,  and click on `Create repository from template`. It is not
necessary to select the `Include all branches` option.

To create a `timelink` user connected to the new repository follow 
[these instructions](new_user_sources_in_git.md).
